# Jekuari's Tmux-sessionizer
Based on ThePrimeagen's [tmux-sessionizer](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer)

## Adjusted for my workflow
This version of tmux-sessionizer contains changes to suit my workflow, such as:
- ### Create different windows for nested repositories:
  I work in different projects and for different companies, so being able to spin up all the nested directories quickly helps my workflow.
- ### Ignore node_modules and .git files:
  I don't need to fuzzy find through my node_modules and .git files, this just makes fzf go slower.
